He was born in Santa Rosa California #707, to Sarah Guevara and Juan Martin Mendoza. Young King was brought up on strong Catholic and Hispanic cultural values. His mother had different plans for his future pushing him to take up a career in law. Fortunately early on he had such a creative mind, that It had a mind of its own. As a kid he loved creating stories in his head, and enjoyed acting them out for family, or the home video camera. At the age of 12 is when he started to pursue his music, and acting career after previous years of training in drama, and classical music. During that summer in 2005, The Disney Channel was looking for new young talented actors, and with no hesitation he jumped at the opportunity. About a week later he got a call from Disney saying that he was invited out of thousands of kids including Devon Werkheiser from "Ned's Declassified School Survival Guide" to auditions for That's So Raven - "The Road to Audition", specifically for the role as Emmett the hall monitor. After trying to explain to his mother that this was a once in a lifetime opportunity at 12, she unfortunately didn't share the same vision for him; like the one he had in his head, and heart. Congratulations to Shane Haboucha 14 at the time, who ended up receiving the part which Young King (Miguel) did watch. Fantastic Job Shane. Fast forward to 2010, his Junior year of High School. As a Junior he was nerves, excited, and worried all in one; but with the same creative passion burning stronger than ever after a 4 year hiatus from The Hollywood Industry. Deep down Young King (Miguel) knew he was special, and he knew he had something that he just couldn't let go off! A deep passion, a hunger that was burning inside. He started talking to one of my teachers who really believed in his same vision, even when he didn't honestly believe in him self at times. She later surprised him with a book of monologues, and said choose one. Practice it, rehearse it, do what you have to do, and I'll film you after school when your ready. She explained to Him that she was going to send the tape to a school that had a summer program, but you needed to be accepted. Later he was sent a letter of acceptance to Cal Arts/Innerspark program, With celebrity mentors Jordan Sparks, and Zac Efron! I know I said OMG too ! ! Unfortunately he passed down the opportunity, with much strain, and later moved to the always sunny Los Angeles California to pursue his career in music, where the stars are in abundance, and the talent comes by the thousands. Fast forward to NOW, 2016. Young King has made cameos &amp; buzz in Major Block Buster hits, film festivals, television series, and national news branches such as CNN. He has rubbed elbows, and walked red carpets with non other than the Kardashian sisters, Pia Mia, Maroon 5, Justin Bieber, Red Foo, Kristinia Debarge, DJ Mustard, Bravo Luciano, Juan Martin Mendoza Jr (Don Makin Moves), Becky G, Shaun Ross, Mario Lopez, Jason Bateman, Ellen Page, Alyson Hannigan, Lucas Cruikshank (Fred Figglehorn) Jennifer Veal, Cat Von D, and many others. He has dedicated the last 11 yrs of his life, breaking boundaries and crossing boarders for the latin community. Now in 2016 he is working on his Debut EP “ The Young King Experience” dropping late 2017. Formerly signed to One Source Management, now in day Independent. Stay tuned for more to come, later these coming months. #YOUNGKING #THEKINGDOM</p></div></section></div><section id="Footer3col" class="Section Section--components-2 Section--footer color-bg color-title z-30 p-1 ms-p-h-2vw  colors-dark colors-local " data-reactid="23"><div class="fx-1 bd-none ms-bd-r ms-bd-w-1" data-reactid="24"><div class="Group Group-heading ms-p-r-4" data-reactid="25"><div class="Site-title color-text-pop" data-reactid="26"><span data-reactid="27"><!-- react-empty: 28 --><h2 class="font-title" data-reactid="29"><a href="index.html" data-reactid="30">BIO</a></h2></span></div></div></div><div class="fx-1" data-reactid="31"><div class="Group Group--links" data-reactid="32"><div class="Group Group--links f-s-m ms-f-s-s w-s-wrap ms-w-s-nowrap" data-reactid="33"></div></div></div></section></div></div>
