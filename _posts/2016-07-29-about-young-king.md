Young King ( Miguel ) Is a crazy, wild, proud Mexican kid from sunny California.

NorCal Native Young King, born Miguel Angel Guevara, 22, is a multi-faceted recording artist, entrepreneur. He was born in Santa Rosa California, to Sarah Guevara and Juan Martin Mendoza. Early on He had such a creative mind, that It had a mind of its own. As a Kid He loved creating stories in my head, and acting them out for my family, or the home video camera. At the age of 12 is when I really wanted, and started to pursue acting, after previous training in drama. That summer I had seen that the Disney Channel was looking for new young talented actors, and I honestly with no hesitation jumped at the opportunity. About a week later I did get a call from Disney saying I was invited out of thousands of kids including Devon Werkheiser from "Ned's Declassified School Survival Guide" to auditions for That's So Raven - "The Road to Audition", specifically for the role as Emmett the hall monitor. After trying to explain to my mother that this was a once in a lifetime opportunity at 12, she unfortunately didn't share the same vision for me; like the one I had in my head, but thats okay ma. Congratulations to Shane Haboucha 14 at the time, who ended up receiving the part which I did watch. Fantastic Job Shane. Fast forward to 2010, my Junior year of High School. I a Junior was nerves, excited, and worried all in one; but with the same creative passion burning stronger than ever after a 4 year hiatus. The craziest part was I knew I was special, and I knew I had something that I just couldn't let go off! A deep passion, a hunger that was burning inside. I started talking to one of my teachers who really believed in me, even when I didn't honestly believe in myself. She later surprised me with a book of monologues, and said choose one. Practice it, rehearse it, do what you have to do, and I'll film you after school when your ready. She explained to me that she was going to send my tape to a school that had a summer program, but you had to be accepted. I was later sent a letter of acceptance to Cal Arts/Innerspark program. With celebrity mentors Jordan Sparks, and Zac Efron! I know I said OMG too.
